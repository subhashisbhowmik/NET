# README

The tutorials presented here are meant to serve as a brief introduction to the
net package. They are *not* meant to teach Neural Network theory: it is assumed
that you are aware of the basics. If you wish to learn about Neural Networks in
general, [this](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) might be a good
place to start.

We also assume that you know basic Python. Having said that, let us begin.

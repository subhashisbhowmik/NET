**Neural Networks in Python**

Putting Neural Networks together should be easier than it usually is. The code
in this repository presents simple Python snippets designed to make prototyping
neural network architectures quick.

**Note**:

* Requires Python.
* Requires NumPy.
* Requires MatplotLib.
* Requires PyOpenCL.
* Requires DisPy.

## Overview

* **net**: this package contains all the modules you will need to create neural
networks quickly. Because that is what you wanted.

* **bench**: this package contains tools used for benchmarking new algorithms.
Because you can do it better.

* **data**: this package contains scripts providing access to common datasets.
Because no one wants to have to go looking for them anyway.

* **tutor**: this folder contains tutorials written to help you get started.
Because the first time is always the hardest.

* **doc**: this folder contains the documentation of the all modules we have
implemented. These are the grizzly mathematical details your professor warned
you about.

* **test**: this folder contains tests we use to make sure everything is
working the way it should. Because things do not always work the way they
should.
